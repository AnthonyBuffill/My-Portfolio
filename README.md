# MY-Portfolio
**Built with React**

 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-MIT-blue)


## Introduction
   
  In this application I was tasked to build a ,uch needed portfolio that will run in the browser. The app is a `single-page application` that is built through `React`. Additionally, it features a number of CSS styling techniques that serve to produce a clean UI with strong animations through various platforms and stylings.  Furthermore I have set up the `EMAILjs` api to attach to my fully functional contact me form which will sumbit to me an email containing whatever unque message a user provides.  I am proud of this application and look forward to any further feedback to improve on its funtionality.  You will find the sit ehas links to all my socials for the convenience of you to contact me through your preferred platforms.
